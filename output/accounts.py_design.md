### Design Overview
1. **Class `Account`**: This class represents a user account containing methods for creating accounts, managing funds, buying and selling shares, and reporting portfolio value, profit/loss, holdings, and transactions.
   
2. **Methods**:
   - `__init__`: Initializes the account with a username and initial deposit.
   - `deposit`: Adds funds to the account.
   - `withdraw`: Removes funds from the account ensuring no overdraft.
   - `buy_shares`: Facilitates the purchase of shares while verifying fund availability.
   - `sell_shares`: Manages selling shares ensuring enough holdings are present.
   - `get_portfolio_value`: Computes the total value of the account.
   - `get_profit_or_loss`: Calculates the profit or loss based on the initial deposit.
   - `get_holdings`: Returns a dictionary of currently held shares and their quantities.
   - `get_transactions`: Lists all historical transaction strings made by the user.

3. **Function `get_share_price`**: Simulates fetching the current price of shares based on symbols with fixed prices for specified stocks.

4. **Overall Structure**: The entire module encapsulates account management functionality and is ready for integration with a frontend interface as described in the requirements.
